Hey üëã, I'm Oliver aka phlourish and currently a **student at a vocational grammar school** specializing in **information technology**.
My educational background also reflects my passion for IT - especially **hardware-related computer science**.
At the moment, my focus is on trying out as many computer science disciplines as possible before specializing in a few.
As a result, I've already dipped my toes into a number of topics, such as
- Automation
- Containerization
- Digital and electrical engineering
- GNU/Linux and *BSD
- Security
- Selfhosting and system administration
- Software engineering
- Systems programming.

The languages I use the most are **C, Go and Python**, even though throughout my learning journey I've tried many more including **Java, Javascript and Nix**.
I strive to improve and expand my knowledge of computer science in the coming years, as I will **start studying computer science at DHBW Karlsruhe next year**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è some of what i've been working on

You can find **all my projects on [github.com/phlourishdev](https://github.com/phlourishdev)**.

### discorddsb - WIP
[discorddsb](https://github.com/phlourishdev/discorddsb) builds a **bridge between DSBmobile's substitute plan service and Discord**.
It uses a database to ensure that notifications sent by a Discord bot are only sent once per substition, and that corrections to substition notifications are made.

### DSBgo
[DSBgo](https://github.com/phlourishdev/DSBgo) provides an interface to the **DSBmobile API for golang applications**.

### PyTalk
PyTalk is a **chat application** built for a school project using the **client-server model**.
[PyTalk Clients](https://github.com/phlourishdev/PyTalk_Client) can connect to a [PyTalk Server](https://github.com/phlourishdev/PyTalk_Server), set a username and
password as well as an encryption key to ensure secure messaging through symmetric encryption. Because of this the encryption key also functions as a kind of chatroom
key.
